# Solvable-Quintic-Pathfinder

Solvable Quintic Path-Finder (2022 | Age 18)

A computational roadmap to navigate and identify the hidden solvable structures of quintic equations.


🎯 Project Scope

This project is about the logic of discovery. Instead of relying on standard library solvers, I developed a systematic way to find the underlying algebraic path that makes a quintic equation solvable.

The goal was to prove that by "feeling" the symmetry of the field extensions, one can accurately navigate from a set of coefficients to the roots, bypassing the "unsolvable" chaos of general fifth-degree polynomials.


🔍 The Finding Sequence

The heart of this project is the logical sequence used to "detect" the solvable path. Through experimentation in Mathematica, I identified these critical stages:

  1. Symmetry Identification: Scanning and isolating quartic subfields to locate the $C_5$ (cyclic) structure hidden within the equation.

  2. Structural Mapping: Pinpointing the core algebraic elements that define the backbone of the solution.

  3. Logic Validation: Applying this "Finding" roadmap to 50+ independent cases that I discovered and verified during this research.


🧠 The 18-Year-Old’s Intuition

I built this at age 18 by treating algebraic structures like a puzzle. I didn't have the formal textbook vocabulary (like Kummer Theory) at the time, but I realized that solvable equations possessed a "numerical harmony" in their subfields.

This repository is a record of that intuitive search process—proving that complex mathematical barriers can be navigated through pure logical persistence and computational experimentation.


Example Solvable Quintic Equations:

x^5+6x^4-26x^3-11x^2+54x+17=0

x^5+8x^4+4x^3-47x^2+30x-4=0

x^5+6x^4+6x^3-11x^2-8x+1=0
