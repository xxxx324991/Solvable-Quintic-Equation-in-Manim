Title: Solvable-Quintic-Explorer


Subtitle: Independent Computational Algebra Research


Core Objective:

To develop a computational framework that identifies and solves solvable quintic equations. While the Abel-Ruffini Theorem proves a general formula is impossible, this project focuses on implementing algorithms to find radical solutions for specific quintic classes by analyzing their underlying algebraic symmetries.


Technical Focus:

Root Finding for Solvable Cases: Implementing methods to extract roots when the equation's Galois group permits.

Symmetry Analysis: Distinguishing between solvable and non-solvable structures.

Numerical Verification: Using his custom Complex class to verify the precision of the results.
