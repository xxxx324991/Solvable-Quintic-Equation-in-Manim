Title: Algebraic Computation of Quintic Equations or Computation of Quintic Equations and Galois Solvability


Overview: A project exploring the boundary of Galois Theory and computational logic. This repository contains the derivation and implementation of algorithms to test the solvability of quintic equations.


Key Features:

•	Galois Group Identification: Algorithms to identify the Galois group of a given polynomial over the rational field $\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., distinguishing between $S_5, A_5$, or solvable subgroups).

•	Abel-Ruffini Theorem Verification: Computational proofs regarding the impossibility of general radical solutions for quintic equations.

•	Symmetric Group Mapping: Logic models representing the permutations of $S_5$ and its normal subgroups.


Implementation

•	Numerical approximation of roots using Python

•	Logical mapping of radical extension fields.

Why it matters: Demonstrates the ability to translate high-level abstract algebra into executable code.
